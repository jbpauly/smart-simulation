### Breakdown of Standard Subscriptions

This simple exercise helps clarify that the standard subscription model is broken for consumer goods.

Hopefully you're not thinking this wasn't a fair assessment.
In reality, this experiment gave a leg up to the standard subscription model.
A short list of variables not included in our framework:
- Holidays
- Extended travel
- Diets or other routine experiments

Or simply put, life.

You could find a close to 'ideal' subscription frequency using the average consumption rate over a period of time for
 a consumer. That, however, would require insight into consumption rates.
 Something a standard subscription doesn't provide.

**IF you're still not convinced about your own inconsistencies in consumption, take a look at mine.**

Across 16 months, I purchased 36 bags of coffee (12 oz.)
The heatmap describes my range of daily consumption intensity (weight).
The Histogram summarizes my purchase frequency. Mean: 13.7 days | Standard Deviation: 7.4 days.
