#### What is a Smart Subscription?

Simply put by Paul Graham, "[it's] like streaming for stuff." More on the [it] later.

The differentiation between digital and physical streaming lies in the balance of supply and demand.
All parties can be happy with over-supply in the digital world.
In the physical world, a much tighter balance is required, and only achieved with just-in-time delivery.
Subscribers receive their goods resupply just before they run out on an as needed basis.
This meets the constant supply criteria for on-demand consumption, and minimizes expensive and wasteful oversupply.

#### How does a Smart Subscription Work?

Bottomless is the first of its kind smart subscription company.
In fact, the company was the subject of Paul Graham's physical streaming epiphany.
They provide smart subscriptions for premium coffee from top roaster across the country.
To achieve just-in-time delivery, Bottomless provides subscribers a wifi connected kitchen scale and monitors
 their consumption.
The consumption, as a way of weight, data is the critical component used to balance supply and demand.

The Bottomless cofounders, Michael and Liana, view every major problem as a legibility problem.
In an interview with Patrick O'Shaughnessy, Michael describes the importance of information legibility:

> "Anytime you can make important information legible to computers, you can change the world.
> If you look at all the revolutions after smartphone penetration,
> it was because people's location was suddenly legible.
> Fundamentally, we're making the stock levels in your house legible to us and coffee sellers."
