# Shop Smarter Not Harder



---
Set the stage
---
- Explore business case and utility of smart subscriptions
    - Smart subscription
    - Standard subscription
- Push against 'this isn't a problem most people have' opinion
- Show my consumption
- Show the range items left in refrigerator
    - Typically on a wide spectrum (bare bones, overstocked)
    - Ideal is goldie locks, just the right amount
        - perishable items are always fresh
        - no need to stock up on on perishables
---
Explain in detail with example
---
- Lets build a profile of 3 coffee drinkers
    - Set up a framework to generate profiles
        - Optional consumer preference each day of the week
            - Probability of coffee consumption
            - Desired amount of servings (with range)
                - each 'serving' can have some variability but trying to follow the 'golden ratio'

    - Profiles
        - Michael
        - Liana
        - Joe
