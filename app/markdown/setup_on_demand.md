Streaming subscriptions are elegantly on-demand: demand once and consume when desired.
Netflix is just one click away, whether or not you feel like binging a few episodes tonight.

In the world of bits, supply can be endless.
In the world of atoms, supply is scarce. It spoils. It takes up physical space.
Compromise is required to be on-demand.

1. Compromise supply with a subscription
    - Demand once
    - Receive on a reoccurring schedule
    - Consume as desired if local supply still available
    - Optionally aggregate too much supply with lower than expected demand
2. Compromise demand without a subscription
    - Demand at will
    - Receive at a later time
    - Consume after desire

Craving and necessity come on a whim and consumption is non-linear on a short time scale.
Standard subscriptions canâ€™t satisfy our on-demand interest in real time.
So, e-commerce giants and last mile delivery startups spend billions attempting to minimize our compromise on demand.
Yet, it will never be enough, because running out of your staple items come at the least opportune times.
The only way to be truly on-demand is to provide supply before the demand.

Today, a new type of consumer subscription meets the requirements for on-demand elegance without compromise.
