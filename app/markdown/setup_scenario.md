To understand the effectiveness of a standard subscription for consumer goods,
we'll used a simplified framework and a few assumptions.
The objective of the subscription is to have fresh coffee available whenever the subscriber wishes to consume it.
**To quantify the effectiveness of the subscription,
we'll track the amount of coffee (oz) available to the consumer throughout the year**.

Assumptions:
- Subscription lasts 365 days and the ordering frequency is held constant
- Each bag of coffee weighs 12 ounces
- The consumers have some repeatability in their consumption
- The amount (oz) of coffee consumed with each serving has some variability

To capture the human nature and habits of our consumers we will give them a consumption profile
for each day of the week, Monday through Sunday with two components:
-	Probability that they will decide to drink
-	Range of desired consumption in servings (count)

Lastly, few points on why we're using coffee as our test product:
- **Freshness matters**. Coffee beans can spoil or stale, so too much stock is undesirable.
- **Availability matters**. Coffee is a habitually consumed product, so no enough stock is also undesirable.

In theory, if one can reliably subscribe to coffee, they should also be able to subscribe to other consumer goods.
