To capture the human nature and habits of our consumers we have a simplified framework. Each day of the week, Monday through Sunday, they have a consumer profile:
-	Probability of consumption
-	Range of desired consumption in servings

This allows for long term habits with short term variability. Lastly, weâ€™ll analyze the amount of coffee (oz) available to determine subscription effectiveness. Some variability in the amount of coffee consumed with each serving is allowed. The weight (oz) of a single serving each day will be randomly selected from a normal distribution: (mean = 0.38, std = 0.05).
